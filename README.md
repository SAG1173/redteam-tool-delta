# redteam-tool-delta

For my tool I created a linux script that will spawn dummy processes with name similar to scored competition services. It only requires running the ansible script tool.yaml to run. The script itself is also very simple and does not require permissions to run so it could be dropped on a machine and run in the background very easily.
